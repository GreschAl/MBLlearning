# MBLlearning-package

This repo contains all relevant information regarding the numerics of the corresponding paper <i> Scalable approach to many-body localization via quantum data <i>, available  [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08853v1)

In particular, it contains
- training and test set
- trained models (for convenience)
- convenience data regarding fig. 9 in the appendix
- `PAPER_NOTEBOOK.py`, a demo python script that loads all the data and reproduces all non-TeX figures including the ones from the appendix. The script can also be used to retrain all models again to check the consistency of our trained models.

The data for the training and the test set can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6482652).
